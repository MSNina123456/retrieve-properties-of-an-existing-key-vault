Retrieve properties of an existing Key Vault
============================================

            



This runbook shows how to retrieve the properties of an existing Key Vault. It requires an Azure Run As account and additional modules, see the PREREQUISITE sections in the runbook for details. The runbook will use the Run As account
 to authenticate against Key Vault. The Run As account needs to have sufficient permissions to access the Key Vault. If successful, the runbook output will display some of the Key Vault's properties.




        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
